                        between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
                        dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
                        as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
                        the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
                        richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
                        the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
                        imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
                        country life and all the variations on love 
                        and family happiness.</td>

                        was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
                        us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
                        woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
                        its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
                        of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
                        Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
                        figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.</td>
